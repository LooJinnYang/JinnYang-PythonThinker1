# # Task 7: Even or Odd? III
# # Create a function that takes in a number and returns whether it is
# # even

# # 1. Create a function named isEven()
# def is_Even(num):

# # 2. If the number is even, the function should return True
# # 3. If the number is odd, the function should return False
#     return num % 2 == 0

# # 4. Using the 'isEven()' function, loop through a list of numbers and
# #    print them out in this format:
# #     "3 is an odd number"
# #     "9 is an odd number"
# #     "2 is an even number"

# nums = [3,5,8,326,4,]

#     if is_Even(num):
#         print(str(num) + " is an even number.")
#     else:
#         print(str(num) + " is an odd number.")
