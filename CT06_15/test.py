#Task 1
# Print numbers from 10 to 200 using the while loop
# Your numbers must be in multiples of 10.
# 10 must be first number printed, and 200 the last number.

# Example: 10, 20, 30 ..... 180, 190, 200.
# Note that the numbers do not need to be printed in one line.
# Write your code here

# i = 10
# while i > 9 and i < 201:
#     print(i)
#     i += 10

# Task 2
# Code a password checker to protect your code!

# Assign a password "superpass123" to a variable
# Ask the user to enter a password
# If the password matches, print “Access Granted”
# If the password does not match, print “Access Denied”

# Write your code here

# password = "superpass123"
# var = input("Insert the password here: ")
# if password == var:
#     print("Access Granted")
# else:
#     print("Access Denied")

# # Basic List Functions
# # Do the following operations to the list provided below
# # Write the code below each question.

# planets = ["mercury","venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus" ]

# # 1. Write code below to print the 3rd item 
# #    in this list using index e.g. earth

# print(planets[2])

# # 2. Write code to append neptune to this list.

# planets.append("neptune")

# # 3. Elon Musk has conquered Mars. 
# #    Rename Mars in the list to be "muskworld"

# planets[3] = "muskworld"

# # 4. Remove uranus from this list.

# # removing from new list

# del(planets[6])

# # 5. Using a for loop, print all the planets 
# #    from this list one by one.

# print("Planets: ")
# for i in range (len(planets)):
#     print(str(i + 1) + "." + planets[i])
